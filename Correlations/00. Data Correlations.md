# Finding Relationships

A great aspect of the Pandas module is the `corr()` method.

The `corr()` method calculates the relationship between each column in your data set.

The examples in this page uses a CSV file called: '[data.csv](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_correlations.asp)'.

```python
# Show the relationship between the columns:
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

print(df.corr())
```

```
          Duration     Pulse  Maxpulse  Calories
Duration  1.000000 -0.059452 -0.250033  0.344341
Pulse    -0.059452  1.000000  0.269672  0.481791
Maxpulse -0.250033  0.269672  1.000000  0.335392
Calories  0.344341  0.481791  0.335392  1.000000
```

## Result Explained

The Result of the **`corr()`** method is a table with a lot of numbers that represents how well the relationship is between two columns.

The number varies from -1 to 1.

1 means that there is a 1 to 1 relationship (a perfect correlation), and for this data set, each time a value went up in the first column, the other one went up as well.

0.9 is also a good relationship, and if you increase one value, the other will probably increase as well.

-0.9 would be just as good relationship as 0.9, but if you increase one value, the other will probably go down.

0.2 means NOT a good relationship, meaning that if one value goes up does not mean that the other will.

💡 **What is a good correlation?**
It depends on(~에 따르지만) the use, but I think it is safe to say you have to have at least 0.6(or -0.6) to call it a good correlation.

## Perfect Correlation:

We can see that ‘Duration’ and ‘Duration’ got the number **`1.000000`**, which makes sense(합리적이다.), each column always has a perfect relationship with itself.

## Good Correlation:

‘Duration’ and ‘Calories’ got a 0.922721 correlation, which is a very good correlation, and we can predict that the longer you work out, the more calories you burn, and the other way around: if you burned a lot of calories, you probably had a long work out. (운동 시간이 길수록 칼로리 소모량도 많아지고, 그 반대의 경우도 마찬가지죠. 칼로리를 많이 소모했다면 운동 시간이 길었을 가능성이 큽니다.)

## Bad Correlation:

‘Duration’ and ‘Maxpulse(최대 맥박)’ got a 0.009403 correlation, which is a very bad correlation, meaning that we can not predict the max pulse by just looking at the duration(기간) of the work out, and vice versa(반대의 경우도 마찬가지이다.).
