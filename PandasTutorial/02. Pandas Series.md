# What is a Series?

A Pandas Series is like a column in a table.

It is a one-dimensional(1차원) array holding(저장) data of any type.

```python
import pandas as pd

a = [1, 7, 2]

myvar = pd.Series(a)
print(myvar)
```

```
0    1
1    7
2    2
dtype: int64
```

## I asked the question to ChatGPT 3.5.

```
❓ This code uses Pandas.

[code]
import pandas as pd

a = [1, 7, 2]

myvar = pd.Series(a)
print(myvar)

[Output]
0    1
1    7
2    2
dtype: int64

Question) Why is 'dtype: int 64' output together?

```

```
⚙ In the output `dtype: int64` that you see when printing the Pandas Series `myvar`, `dtype` stands for "data type," and **`int64` specifies the specific data type of the elements within the Pandas Series.**

Let's break down what `dtype: int64` means:

1. **dtype**: This is short(약자) for "data type," which indicates(저장) the type of data(유형) stored in the Pandas Series.
2. **int64**: This specifies(지정) the specific data type of the elements in the Series. In this case, `int64` means that all the elements in the Series `myvar` are integers (`int`), and specifically, they are stored(저장) using 64-bit integer format (`int64`).

**So, when you see `dtype: int64` alongside the Series output, it's simply telling you the type of data (integer) and the specific format used to store those integers (64-bit format).** 

**(따라서 Series 출력과 함께 dtype: int64가 표시되면 이는 단순히 데이터 유형(정수)과 해당 정수를 저장하는 데 사용되는 특정 형식(64비트 형식)을 알려주는 것입니다.)**

# Labels

If nothing else is specified, the values are labeled with their index number. First Value has index 0, second value has index 1 etc.

This label can be used to access a specified value.

```python
# Return the first value of the Series:
import pandas as pd

a = [1, 7, 2]

myvar = pd.Series(a)

print(myvar[0]) # 1
```

## Create Labels

With the **`index`** argument, you can name your own labels.

```python
import pandas as pd

a = [1, 7, 2]

myvar = pd.Series(a, index = ['x', 'y', 'z'])

print(myvar)
```

```
x    1
y    7
z    2
dtype: int64
```

when you have created labels, you can access an item by referring to the label.

```python
import pandas as pd

a = [1, 7, 2]

myvar = pd.Series(a, index = ['x', 'y', 'z'])
print(myvar['y']) # 7
```

# Key/Value Objects as Series

You can also use a key/value object, like a dictionary, when creating a Series.

```python
import pandas as pd

calories = {'day1':420, 'day2':380, 'day3':390}

myvar = pd.Series(calories)

print(myvar)
```

```
day1    420
day2    380
day3    390
dtype: int64
```

```
💡 The keys of the dictionary become the labels.

```

To(~하려면) select only some of the items in the dictionary, use the index argument and specify only the items you want to include in the Series.

```python
import pandas as pd

calories = {'day1':420, 'day2':380, 'day3':390}

myvar = pd.Series(calories, index = ['day1', 'day2'])
print(myvar)
```

```
day1    420
day2    380
dtype: int64
```

# DataFrames

Data Sets in Pandas are usually multi-dimensional tables, called DataFrames.

Series is like a column, a DataFrame is the whole table.

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {
  "calories": [420, 380, 390],
  "duration": [50, 40, 45]
}

myvar = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(myvar)
```

```
  calories  duration
0       420        50
1       380        40
2       390        45
```
