# Installation of Pandas

If you have Python and PIP already installed on a system, then installation of Pandas is very easy.

Install it using this command:

```python
pip install pandas
pip3 install pandas
```

```
ðŸ’¡ My Mac already installed Python and Vscode. So I using that command on a Vscode Terminal.
```

# Import Pandas

Once Pandas is installed, import it in your applications by adding the **`import`** keyword:

```python
import pandas
```

Now Pandas is imported and ready to use.

```python
import Pandas

mydataset = {
	'cars' : ["BMW", "Volvo", "Ford"],
	'passings' : [3, 7, 2]
}

myvar = pandas.DataFrame(mydataset)
print(myvar)
```

```
    cars  passings
0    BMW         3
1  Volvo         7
2   Ford         2
```

# Pandas as pd

Pandas is usually imported under the **`pd`** alias(ë³„ì¹­).

```python
**import pandas as pd**
```

Now the Pandas package can be referred to as **`pd`** instead of **`pandas`**.

```python
import pandas as pd

mydataset = {
  'cars': ["BMW", "Volvo", "Ford"],
  'passings': [3, 7, 2]
}

myvar = pd.DataFrame(mydataset)

print(myvar)
```

```
    cars  passings
0    BMW         3
1  Volvo         7
2   Ford         2
```

# Checking Pandas Version

The version string is stored(ì €ìž¥) under **`__version__`** attribute.

```python
import pandas as pd

print(pd.__version__) # 1.0.3
```
