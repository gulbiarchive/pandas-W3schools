# Plotting

Pandas uses the **`plot()`** method to create diagrams.

We can use Pyplot, a submodule of the Matplotlib library to visualize the diagram on the screen.

Read more about Matplotlib in our [Matplotlib Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_intro.asp).

```python
# Import pyplot from Matplotlib and visualize our DataFrame:
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pylot as plt # Matplotlib은 Python에서 정적, 애니메이션 및 대화형 시각화를 만드는 포괄적인 라이브러리

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

df.plot()
plt.show()
# Summary
# plot(): Creates the plot from the DataFrame.
# show(): Displays the plot on the screen.
```

```python
#Three lines to make our compiler able to draw:
import sys
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

df.plot()

plt.show()

#Two  lines to make our compiler able to draw:
plt.savefig(sys.stdout.buffer)
sys.stdout.flush()
```

# Scatter Plot(산포도)

- 데이터가 얼마나 퍼져 있는지 설명하는 지표(흩어진 정도)

Specify that you want a scatter plot with the kind argument:

**`kind = ‘scatter’`**

A scatter plot needs an x- and a y- axis.

In the example below we will use ‘Duration’ for the x-axis and ‘Calories’ for the y-axis.

Include the x and y arguments like this:

**`x = ‘Duration’, y = ‘Calories’`**

```python
#Three lines to make our compiler able to draw:
import sys
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

df.plot(kind = 'scatter', x = 'Duration', y = 'Calories')

plt.show()

#Two  lines to make our compiler able to draw:
plt.savefig(sys.stdout.buffer)
sys.stdout.flush()
```

<aside>
💡 Remember: In the previous example, we learned that the correlation between ‘Duration’ and ‘Calories’ was **`0.922721`**, and we concluded with the fact that higher duration(기간) means more calories burned.

</aside>

Let’s create another scatterplot, where there is a bad relationship between the columns, like ‘Duration’ and ‘Maxpulse’, with the correlation **`0.009403`**:

```python
#Three lines to make our compiler able to draw:
import sys
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

df.plot(kind = 'scatter', x = 'Duration', y = 'Maxpulse')

plt.show()

#Two  lines to make our compiler able to draw:
plt.savefig(sys.stdout.buffer)
sys.stdout.flush()
```

# Histogram

Use the **`kind`** argument to specify that you want a histogram:

**`kind = ‘hist’`**

A histogram needs only one column.

A histogram shows us the frequency of each interval, e.g. how many workouts lasted between 50 and 60 minutes?

In the example below we will use the ‘Duration’ column to create the histogram:

```python
#Three lines to make our compiler able to draw:
import sys
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

**df["Duration"].plot(kind = 'hist')**

plt.show()

#Two  lines to make our compiler able to draw:
plt.savefig(sys.stdout.buffer)
sys.stdout.flush()

```

<aside>
💡 The histogram tells us that there were over 100 workouts that lasted between 50 and 60 minutes.
